Car Price Prediction Model
This project implements a machine learning model for predicting car prices based on various features of the cars. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, and it utilizes a Sequential neural network architecture.

Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluating the model consists of information about different cars, including features such as mileage, horsepower, number of cylinders, etc., along with their corresponding prices. The dataset is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets for model training and evaluation.

Model Architecture
The neural network model is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras. It consists of an input layer, a normalization layer for preprocessing the input data, followed by multiple dense (fully connected) layers with ReLU activation functions. The output layer predicts the price of the car.

Training and Evaluation
The model is trained using the training dataset and evaluated using the testing dataset. Training progress and performance metrics such as loss are monitored during the training process. Additionally, the model's performance is evaluated on the testing dataset to assess its ability to generalize to unseen data.
